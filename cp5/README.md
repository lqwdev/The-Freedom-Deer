# Steps to Run Analysis

Our analysis is split into two parts, sentiment analysis and regression analysis. Instructions to run each step is listed below.


## Sentiment Analysis

First we need to generate sentiment analysis scores for our existing data using a pretrained BERT NLP model. This is done in the Jupyter notebook `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`.

To start the notebook, run:

```
jupyter notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb
```

Then within the notebook, run all the cells. The notebook will automatically save the results in a local csv file `cp5_data_with_sa_score.csv`.


## Regression Analysis

Our regression analysis is done in `regression.ipynb`.

To start the notebook, run:

```
jupyter notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb
```

Then run all the cells within the notebook to see the analysis.
