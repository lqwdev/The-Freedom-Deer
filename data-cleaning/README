# Requirements

Our script runs on Python 3 and uses the following libraries that
may need to be installed before it can run.

All of these requirements can be installed using pip.

* pandas
* numpy
* sqlite3
* psycopg2
  * Requires an installation of postgresql


# How to run our data cleaning pipeline

Our script is packaged under `run.py` and is easy to run:

```
python3 src/run.py
```

Please note that you MUST run this command from the root
directory, not from the `src/` directory.
