# How to use this repository

To clone the repository, run the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lqwdev/ai339-project.git
```

Our repository references the `chicago-police-data` using git submodules, we need to also fetch all recursive repositories. We have setup simple commands in `Makefile` to simplify this.

To fetch submodules, run the following command

```bash
make clone-data
```
