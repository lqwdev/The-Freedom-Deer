# MSAI 339 Data Science Project

**Team: The Freedom Deer**

## Theme

Our research revolved around answering the following guiding questions:

1. What makes someone more risky towards experiencing the use of force?
2. What are the typical scenarios in which police officers tend to use force?

Our main goal was to investigate the conditions under which police officers tend to use force on civilians. We believe that there are many reasons including the race of the subject, the environment under which the conflicts happened, the physical location in Chicago (neighborhood demographics), etc. We would like to explore how each of these conditions influences the police officer’s choice to use force and how they interact with each other to impact as a whole.

Specifically, we focused on the differentiated treatments civilians receive from the police officers by studying the characteristics of the cases involved in the complaint and tactical response report. For example, is a specific race more likely to become the victim of police officers’ use of force? Does the race of the police officer play a role in this as well? Whether cross-race interaction increases the likelihood of use of force.

Under each race, we looked into the environmental factors that could work together to influence the decisions of the force usage, including weather, physical location, time of the day. For example, whether the use of force occurs more often in the neighborhoods with a cluster of certain races and whether the reduced visibility of black people increases the incentive for force usage.
