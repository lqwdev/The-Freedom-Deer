\title{Checkpoint 1: SQL Analytics Findings}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The main goal of our research is to investigate the conditions under which police officers tend to use force on civilians. Specifically we believe that race and environmental conditions play a critical role in this, therefore in this report, we utilized SQL to analyze and answer some important questions. The questions are grouped into sections and each section contains multiple questions about the same topic.

\section*{1. Information about Victims and Officers}

We would like to first gather some background information about the officers and victims in the use of force cases, such as race distribution. The data in this section is taken from the \texttt{trr\_trr}, \texttt{data\_officer}, and \texttt{data\_racepopulation} datasets.

\subsection*{1a. What is the racial distribution of the victims and officers involved in cases of use of force in tactical response reports?}

\underline{\textbf{Subject Race:}}
\begin{verbatim}
          subject_race          | count
--------------------------------+-------
 Black                          | 49747
 Hispanic                       |  9369
 White                          |  6540
 Asian/Pacific Islander         |   431
 Native American/Alaskan Native |    54
\end{verbatim}


\underline{\textbf{Police Officer Race:}}
\begin{verbatim}
           officer_race         | count
--------------------------------+-------
 White                          | 38731
 Hispanic                       | 15064
 Black                          | 10599
 Asian/Pacific                  |  2028
 Native American/Alaskan Native |   310
\end{verbatim}

From the results, we can see the race distribution of the subjects and polie officers involved in the use of force cases.

The table shows that black subjects are the dominant race which has contributed to cases more than the total of all other races combined. However, as we know that black people do not dominate the total population in Chicago, this indicates a worth-of-investigating racial discrimination involved in the police use of force.

From the results, we can see the race distribution of police officers involved in use of force cases. At the top is white police officers whose count exceeds the total of the rest of the races, especially in contrast to the number of Asian/Pacific and Native American/Alaskan Native police officers. This potentially leads to a white-dominated culture in police department.


\subsection*{1b. What portion of these use of force cases involves an officer that is of a different race than that of the victim (cross-race use of force) and what are the racial distributions of the subjects and officers in these cases?}

\underline{\textbf{Cross-Race Use of Force Percentage:}}
\begin{verbatim}
 cross_race_percentage
-----------------------
              0.732046
\end{verbatim}

\underline{\textbf{Detailed View of Race Distribution of Subject and Officers:}}

   0.003357 | Native American/Alaskan Native | Black
   0.002552 | Hispanic                       |
   0.001805 | Black                          |
   0.001044 | Hispanic                       | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000731 | Black                          | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000627 | Native American/Alaskan Native | Hispanic
   0.000537 | White                          | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000463 | Native American/Alaskan Native | White
   0.000418 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000358 | Asian/Pacific Islander         |
   0.000194 | Hispanic                       | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000179 | Native American/Alaskan Native |
   0.000045 | Black                          | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000030 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Native American/Alaskan Native
\end{verbatim}

Based on the results, we can see that cross-race use of force cases make up 73.2\% of total use of force cases, which is less surprising considering the fact that victims are dominated by black people and police officers are dominated with white. Nevertheless, 73.2\% is high enough to raise follow-up questions about the different dynamics between police and victims. Specifically, we will look into the racial composition of the cross-race cases.

The results provides a more detailed view of the racial components of the subjects and police officers in all the use of force cases. A cursive scan shows us that 41\% of all cases come from white police officers' use of force on black subjects. Further analysis shows that cases with black subjects make up 71.58\% of all use of force cases. This indicates that the black population are more prone to police's use of force.


\subsection*{1c. What portion of these cases involved police officer firearm usage?}

\begin{verbatim}
 firearm_used_percentage
-------------------------
                  0.0153
\end{verbatim}

Based on the results, we can see that only 1.5\% use of force cases involved the usage of firearms. This indicates a less number of firearm usage than what we expected, despite large media coverage on this topic.

The results above show that in the 10 most populous regions in the Chicago metropolitan area, the Hispanic population makes up most of the population and the Black population is not the dominant one, but previous data shows that the Black population is the dominant race in police use of force cases.

Future research direction would be to look into the use of force cases happening in these most populous areas. We would also look into use of force cases happening in regions where the Black population make up the majority of the population.


\section*{2. Environmental Factors That May Affect an Officer’s Decision to Use Force}

Next we want to investigate the influence of environmental factors on a police officer's decision to use force. The following questions will looking into some of these factors. The data in this section is taken from the \texttt{trr\_trr} dataset.


\subsection*{2a. What portion of the use of force happened under different lighting conditions?}

\begin{verbatim}
 lighting_condition | percentage
--------------------+------------
 GOOD ARTIFICIAL    |   0.395291
 DAYLIGHT           |   0.293887
 NIGHT              |   0.118295
 POOR ARTIFICIAL    |   0.111580
                    |   0.054283
 DUSK               |   0.021113
 DAWN               |   0.005551
\end{verbatim}

This table shows that the use of force cases are dominated by the scenarios with good lighting (either with daylight of good artificial light). This, to some extend, suggests that lack of visibility is not a risk for someone to experience use of force, which is opposite to our hypothesis.


\subsection*{2b. What portion of the use of force happened under different weather conditions?}

\begin{verbatim}
 weather_condition | percentage
-------------------+------------
 CLEAR             |   0.810218
 RAIN              |   0.060058
                   |   0.056685
 OTHER             |   0.038959
 SNOW              |   0.027977
 FOG/SMOKE/HAZE    |   0.003312
 SEVERE CROSS WIND |   0.001477
 SLEET/HAIL        |   0.001313
\end{verbatim}

This indicates that adverse weather conditions might not be an attribute for use of force which is opposite to our hypothesis. This would allow us to eliminate the influence of weather conditions from our future research.


\subsection*{2c. Under what combinations of different conditions (lighting, indoor or outdoor, weather, location) is a police officer more likely to use force?}

\begin{verbatim}
 weather | indoor_or_outdoor | lighting_condition |         location_recode         | count

 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | NIGHT              | Sidewalk                        |  1891
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Police Facility/Veh Parking Lot |  1836
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Apartment                       |  1498
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Residence                       |  1357
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | POOR ARTIFICIAL    | Street                          |  1313
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | DAYLIGHT           | Alley                           |  1294
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | POOR ARTIFICIAL    | Sidewalk                        |  1198

  ...... truncated ......
\end{verbatim}

This table provides a more comprehensive view of the narratives for the most common scenarios of police's use of force. Most cases happened with in good lighting conditions on the street.

Based on the results for each race, we can see that most use of force cases happen outdoors in clear weather under good lighting conditions. Further analysis shows that these results do not differ much between different races. The interesting part here is that most use of force cases don't happen under bad conditions as we hypothesized. This probably indicates that most police activity happens under favorable conditions and that police activity is not common when conditions are bad. Further research should be conducted to dig deeper into each of these conditions.


\section*{Conclusion and Future Research}

Based on the race distributions of victims and police officers, we can see that the black population is the dominant race in the victims of police use of force. We also saw that cross-race use of force is common and made up 73\% of all the use of force cases. Furthermore we also saw that a white police officer is more likely to use force on a black subject. These results suggest that the black population is more prone to police use of force and we would like to dig deeper into racial issues. On the other hand, in the most populous areas in Chicago, the Black population is not the dominant race. We would look into use of force cases happening in these areas and cases happening in areas where the black population is the dominant race.

We also investigated how environmental conditions affected a police officer's decision to use force and concluded that most police use of force cases happened in favorable environmental condtions, such as good lighting and good weather. Since these environmental conditions didn't seem to influence an officer's decision that much, we would like to further investigate the physical location in which the case occurred, such as the neighborhood's socioeconomic status, median income, and crime rate. We believe that this will provide us with more information going forward.
