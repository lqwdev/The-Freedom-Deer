\title{Checkpoint 1: SQL Analytics Findings}
\author{The Freedom Deer: Tianchang Li, Hualiang Qin, Qingwei Lan}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The main goal of our research is to investigate the conditions under which police officers tend to use force on civilians. Specifically we believe that race and environmental conditions play a critical role in this, therefore in this report, we utilized SQL to analyze and answer some important questions.

The questions are split into sections and each section contains multiple questions.

Note that all \texttt{.sql} files can be run with \texttt{psql cpdb cpdb < filename.sql}.

\section*{1. Information about Victims and Officers}

We would like to first gather some information about the officers and victims in the use of force cases. The data in this section is taken from the \texttt{trr\_trr} and \texttt{data\_officer} datasets.

\subsubsection*{1a. What is the racial distribution of the victims involved in cases of use of force?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
          subject_race          | count
--------------------------------+-------
 Black                          | 49747
 Hispanic                       |  9369
 White                          |  6540
 Asian/Pacific Islander         |   431
 Native American/Alaskan Native |    54
\end{verbatim}

From the results, we can see the race distribution of the subjects involved in the use of force cases. The table shows that black subjects are the dominant race which has contributed to cases more than the total of the other race. However, as we know that black people do not dominate the total population in Chicago. This indicates a worth-of-investigaing racial discrimination involved in the police use of force


\subsubsection*{1b. What is the racial distribution of police officers involved in these cases?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
           officer_race         | count
--------------------------------+-------
 White                          | 38731
 Hispanic                       | 15064
 Black                          | 10599
 Asian/Pacific                  |  2028
 Native American/Alaskan Native |   310
\end{verbatim}

From the results, we can see the race distribution of police officers involved in use of force cases. At the top is white police officers whose count exceeds the total of the rest of the races, especially in contrast to the number of Asian/Pacific and Native American/Alaskan Native police officers. This potentially leads to a white-dominated culture in police department


\subsubsection*{1c. What portion of the total use of force cases involves an officer that is of a different race than that of the victim (cross-race use of force)?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 cross_race_percentage
-----------------------
              0.732046
\end{verbatim}

Based on the results, we can see that cross-race use of force cases make up 73.2\% of total use of force cases, which is less surprising considering the fact that victims are dominated by black people and police offers are dominated with white. Nevertheless, 73.2\% is high enough to raise follow-up questions about the different dynamics between police and victims. Specifically, we will look into the racial composition of the cross-race cases.


\subsubsection*{1d. What portion of the cases in use of force containing firearm usage.}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 firearm_used_percentage
-------------------------
                  0.0153
\end{verbatim}

Based on the results, we can see that only 1.5\% use of force cases involved the usage of firearms. This indicates a less number of firearm usage than what we expected, despite of a large media coverage on this topic.


\subsubsection*{1e. What are the percentages of use of force cases grouped by officer race and subject race? (i.e. what is the percentage of white officers using force on black subjects)}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 percentage |          officer_race          |          subject_race
------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------
   0.416733 | White                          | Black
   0.157269 | Hispanic                       | Black
   0.141796 | Black                          | Black
   0.083096 | White                          | Hispanic
   0.065161 | White                          | White
   0.043256 | Hispanic                       | Hispanic
   0.020457 | Hispanic                       | White
   0.019950 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Black
   0.008147 | White                          |
   0.006923 | Black                          | White
   0.006849 | Black                          | Hispanic
   0.005536 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Hispanic
   0.004238 | White                          | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.003969 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | White
   0.003357 | Native American/Alaskan Native | Black
   0.002552 | Hispanic                       |
   0.001805 | Black                          |
   0.001044 | Hispanic                       | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000731 | Black                          | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000627 | Native American/Alaskan Native | Hispanic
   0.000537 | White                          | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000463 | Native American/Alaskan Native | White
   0.000418 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Asian/Pacific Islander
   0.000358 | Asian/Pacific Islander         |
   0.000194 | Hispanic                       | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000179 | Native American/Alaskan Native |
   0.000045 | Black                          | Native American/Alaskan Native
   0.000030 | Asian/Pacific Islander         | Native American/Alaskan Native
\end{verbatim}

The results provides a more detailed view of the racial components of the subjects and police officers in all the use of force cases. A cursive scan shows us that 41\% of all cases come from white police officers' use of force on black subjects. Further analysis shows that cases with black subjects make up 71.58\% of all use of force cases. This indicates that black people are more prone to police's use of force.


\section*{2. Environmental Factors That May Affect an Officerâ€™s Decision to Use Force}

Next we want to investigate the influence of environmental factors on a police officer's decision to use force. The following questions will address some of these factors.

\subsubsection*{2a. What portion of the use of force happened under different lighting conditions?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 lighting_condition | percentage
--------------------+------------
 GOOD ARTIFICIAL    |   0.395291
 DAYLIGHT           |   0.293887
 NIGHT              |   0.118295
 POOR ARTIFICIAL    |   0.111580
                    |   0.054283
 DUSK               |   0.021113
 DAWN               |   0.005551
\end{verbatim}

This table shows that the use of force cases are dominated by the scenarios with good lighting (either with daylight of good artificial light). This, to some extend, suggests that lack of visibility is not a risk for someone to experience use of force, which is opposite to our hypothesis.

\subsubsection*{2b. What portion of the use of force happened indoors against outdoors?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 indoor_or_outdoor | percentage
-------------------+------------
 Outdoor           |   0.705248
 Indoor            |   0.240962
                   |   0.053791
\end{verbatim}

This shows that most cases occurred outdoor with still descent amount of cases happening indoor. Civilians are usually supposed to be under protection at their esidential area unless severe criminal commitment. Thus, it would be interesting to look into the conditions and the allegation outcomes of these cases.

\subsubsection*{2c. What portion of the use of force happened under different weather conditions?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 weather_condition | percentage
-------------------+------------
 CLEAR             |   0.810218
 RAIN              |   0.060058
                   |   0.056685
 OTHER             |   0.038959
 SNOW              |   0.027977
 FOG/SMOKE/HAZE    |   0.003312
 SEVERE CROSS WIND |   0.001477
 SLEET/HAIL        |   0.001313
\end{verbatim}

This indicates that adverse weather condition might not be a attribute for use of force which is opposite to our hypothesis.

\subsubsection*{2d. What portion of the use of force happened under different locations?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
           location_recode            | percentage
--------------------------------------+------------
 Street                               |   0.278100
 Sidewalk                             |   0.219997
 Residence                            |   0.063683
 Apartment                            |   0.057417
 Police Facility/Veh Parking Lot      |   0.057014
 Alley                                |   0.056178
 Residence Porch/Hallway              |   0.043943
 Residential Yard (Front/Back)        |   0.031573
 Parking Lot/Garage (Non-Residential) |   0.026037
 Other                                |   0.021904
 Chicago Housing Authority Property   |   0.019412
 Gas Station                          |   0.010863
 Park Property                        |   0.009729

 ...... truncated ......
\end{verbatim}

This shows that police's use of force more likely to occur on street/sidewalks but not by much

\subsubsection*{2e. Under what combinations of different conditions (lighting, indoor or outdoor, weather, location) is a police officer more likely to use force?}

\underline{Database Query Results:}

\begin{verbatim}
 weather | indoor_or_outdoor | lighting_condition |         location_recode         | count
---------+-------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------+--------
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Street                          |  5870
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | DAYLIGHT           | Street                          |  5587
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | DAYLIGHT           | Sidewalk                        |  4621
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Sidewalk                        |  4290
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | NIGHT              | Street                          |  2278
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | NIGHT              | Sidewalk                        |  1891
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Police Facility/Veh Parking Lot |  1836
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Apartment                       |  1498
 CLEAR   | Indoor            | GOOD ARTIFICIAL    | Residence                       |  1357
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | POOR ARTIFICIAL    | Street                          |  1313
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | DAYLIGHT           | Alley                           |  1294
 CLEAR   | Outdoor           | POOR ARTIFICIAL    | Sidewalk                        |  1198

  ...... truncated ......
\end{verbatim}

This table provides a more comprehensive of the narratives for the most common scenarios of police's use of force. Cases often time happened with good lighting on the street.
