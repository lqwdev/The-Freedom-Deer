Ideas

- race (officer/complainants)
  - cross race complaints (sustained?)
- split region by race
- allegation outcomes / settlements
- injury rate
- multiple / repeated complaints for same officer
- rank / seniority of officer
  - promotion rate
  - salary


Themes chosen

- promotion rate, salary vs misconduct rate
- race and status complainants (race of officer) vs how likely their complaints are sustained
- settlements
- profiling bad officers vs good officers
- status of officers after receiving complaints
- which category of complaint influences status of officer most
  - does race play a role here
